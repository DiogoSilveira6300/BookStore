# BookStore
## Abstract
Our project consists of a web app designed to work as a marketplace for books. Our system will allow for consumer to business interactions as well as business to business ones. This means that consumers will be able to buy the books displayed in our application, while other businesses, namely book publishers, will be able to add their own books for sale in our platform.
The promoter will make money from all the transactions that are being conducted on its platform, in the form of commissions from the book sales.

**Main Features**

 1. Book searches according to the consumer's interests;
 2. Taking orders from prospective buyers;
 3. Stock management for publishers;
 4. Commission collecting for the promoter.
